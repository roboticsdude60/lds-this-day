## LDS This Day
An app that each day shows you various events in lds history. For example, 150 years ago today some cool thing happened. 

You can select a specific month and day and view those events too. 

There is also an admin portal for creating and editing these events. When events are added they are immediately available in the app (fetches from the backend).

__There are not yet events in the database for every day of the year. For a more interesting experience, try selecting days that do have data such as Dec 7th!__
